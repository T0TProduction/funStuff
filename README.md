# abccba
The premise of this challenge was to find a!=b!=c for which this applies:
with abc not being multiplication but a decimal number with the length of 3 -> abc * 3 = cba

The code is a brute force approach, which gives us the answer pretty quick. (O(10^3))
If there were more possible inputs the code would've needed to be optimized.
