The premise of this challenge was to find a!=b!=c for which this applies:

The code is a brute force approach, which gives us the answer pretty quick because of the ![complexity](http://www.sciweavers.org/upload/Tex2Img_1529599122/eqn.png) complexity of the problem.

If there were more possible inputs the code would've needed to be optimized.
